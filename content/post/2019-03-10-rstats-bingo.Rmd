I just wrapped up another round of teaching stats. I co-teach two courses per year as an adjunct instructor: one class that covers intro stats and the other that hits higher level concepts. Both courses move at a high pace; they're intended to be a survey course for professionals with a STEM background. Some students have a math background, but have never taken a statistics course. Other students have had statistics a long time ago in their undergraduate studies, but want to brush up on the material. 

In both classes, by the time we get to the end, the students appreciate a light hearted activity. I found bingo to be the perfect activity to reveiew material and have a little fun. Jenny Bryan and Dean Attali have an [R Shiny app](https://daattali.com/shiny/bingo/) for creating such bingo games. Their site has a handful of pre-populated game themes such as "boring meeting" and "bad data". Or you can choose to create your own by pasting a list of words. 

I created my own bingo questions that I ask during the game and answers that are written on the bingo cards. (Tip: Don't forget to bring the associated list of questions to class like I did!) I've pasted the questions and answers below that I used for each class. 

Lastly, don't forget the sugar! M&M's make great bingo chips. And, cookies decorated with statsistics are a crowd pleaser.

| 7. The Central Limit Theorem says that the distribution of the mean converges to this distribution as $n$ goes to infinity (variance must be defined). | normal |
| 8. The ____ distribution approximates the Binomial when $n$ is large and $p$ is small. In this case we set $\lambda=np$. | Poisson |

| 3. Probability density function for 2 or more variables | Joint PDF |
| 4. Function used to count number of possibilities: without replacement, order doesn't matter | choose |
| 5. Result of integrating $f(X,Y)$ with respect to $Y$, over the support of $Y$ | marginal of $X$ |
| 6. An alternative to frequentist statistical analysis | Bayesian statistics |
| 7. CLT says that the distribution of the mean converges to this distribution as $n$ goes to infinity (variance must be defined) | Normal |
| 8. $P(A \cap B) = P(A \text{ given } B)$ * ____ | $P(B)$ |

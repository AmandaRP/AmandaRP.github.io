<p>I just wrapped up another round of teaching stats. I co-teach two courses per year as an adjunct instructor: one class that covers intro stats and the other that hits higher level concepts. Both courses move at a high pace; they’re intended to be a survey course for professionals with a STEM background. Some students have a math background, but have never taken a statistics course. Other students have had statistics a long time ago in their undergraduate studies, but want to brush up on the material.</p>
<p>In both classes, by the time we get to the end, the students appreciate a light hearted activity. I found bingo to be the perfect activity to reveiew material and have a little fun. Jenny Bryan and Dean Attali have an <a href="https://daattali.com/shiny/bingo/">R Shiny app</a> for creating such bingo games. Their site has a handful of pre-populated game themes such as “boring meeting” and “bad data”. Or you can choose to create your own by pasting a list of words.</p>
<p>I created my own bingo questions that I ask during the game and answers that are written on the bingo cards. (Tip: Don’t forget to bring the associated list of questions to class like I did!) I’ve pasted the questions and answers below that I used for each class.</p>
<p>Lastly, don’t forget the sugar! M&amp;M’s make great bingo chips. And, cookies decorated with statsistics are a crowd pleaser.</p>

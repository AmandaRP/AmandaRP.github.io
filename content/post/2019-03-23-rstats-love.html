<p>My MO on twitter is to “like” posts that contain information that I’d like remember. The majority of these posts are related to #rstats. I now have 450 likes, which is time consuming to browse through. In this post, I use the <a href="https://rtweet.info/index.html">rtweet</a> package to summarize my Twitter likes. This was my first time using the <code>rtweet</code> package, so I’ll also provide a brief intro.</p>

<p>To grab the tweets, there is a little setup with Twitter that is necessary. The setup is described on the <code>rtweet</code> website <a href="https://rtweet.info/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>TODO: Am having issues authenticating token. Install dev version of rtweet. Then follow instructions here: <a href="https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet/issues/156" class="uri">https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet/issues/156</a></p>

<p>I love that Twitter came out with bookmarks! My pevious MO on Twitter is to “like” posts that contain information that I want to keep for later, most of which are #rstats tweets. I now have TODO likes, which is time consuming to browse through. In this post, I use the <a href="https://rtweet.info/index.html">rtweet</a> package to summarize my Twitter likes. This was my first time using the <code>rtweet</code> package, so I’ll also provide a <a href="">brief intro</a>. Click <a href="">here</a> to jump to the summary.</p>

<p>To grab the tweets, there is a little setup with Twitter that is necessary. The setup is described on the <code>rtweet</code> website <a href="https://rtweet.info/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>During setup, I ran into a bit of an issue authenticating my Twitter app. I’m working in RStudio on an AWS instance. The issue and work-around is described by the package author <a href="https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet/issues/156">here</a>.</p>
<p>TODO: Am having issues authenticating token. Install dev version of rtweet. Then follow instructions here: <a href="https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet/issues/156" class="uri">https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet/issues/156</a></p>

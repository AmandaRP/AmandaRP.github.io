<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=psalms&amp;qs_version=GNT">Psalms</a> is a book in both the Christian Bible and the Jewish Tanakh. I thought it would be interesting to look at a sentiment analysis of the book. I chose to work with the “Good News Translation” of the bible as it does not have copyright issues like some of the other translations (per the <a href="https://scripture.api.bible/">American Bible Society</a>). We’ll use the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidytext">tidytext</a> and <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sentimentr">sentimentr</a> R packages to do the analysis. Let’s start by reading data from <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/">biblegateway.com</a> (using <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rvest">rvest</a>) and doing a bit of cleaning:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Pull text and do a bit of cleaning:
get_chapter &lt;- function(chapter){
  
  url &lt;- str_c(&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+&quot;, 
               chapter, 
               &quot;&amp;version=GNT&quot;)
  
  html &lt;- read_html(url)
  
  text &lt;- html %&gt;% 
    html_node(&quot;.passage-wrap&quot;) %&gt;% 
    html_text() %&gt;%
    str_extract(&quot;\\(GNT.{1,}&quot;) %&gt;%
    str_replace(&quot;\\(GNT\\)&quot;,&quot;&quot;) %&gt;%
    str_extract(&quot;\\d.{1,}&quot;) %&gt;%
    str_replace_all(&quot;\\d{1,}&quot;, &quot;&quot;) %&gt;%
    str_replace_all(&quot;\\[\\w{1}\\]&quot;,&quot;&quot;)
}

#Use the function defined above to read all 150 chapters.
chapters &lt;- map_chr(1:150, get_chapter) %&gt;% 
  tibble::enframe(name = &quot;ch_num&quot;, value = &quot;text&quot;) </code></pre>
<div id="positive-and-negative-word-lexicon" class="section level1">
<h1>Positive and Negative Word Lexicon</h1>
<p>Next, we’ll use the <code>tidytext</code> package to tokenize (i.e. split the text by words) and join our data with a dictionary of sentiment words. For more information about text analysis using <code>tidytext</code>, see <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/">Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach</a> by Julia Silge and David Robinson. <code>tidytext</code> comes with sentiment dictionaries, but I’m going to use the Jockers &amp; Rinker sentiment dictionary from the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lexicon">lexicon</a> package to better compare with a follow-on analysis using the <code>sentimentr</code> package. This dictionary contains positive and negative words and an associated sentiment score in the range [-1, 1]. A value of 1 is the most positive, 0 is neutral, and negative 1 is most negative.</p>
<p>Let’s first look at a comparison word cloud to compare the frequency of the positive and negative words in the book.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Tokenize and join with sentiment lexicon:
psalms_sentiment_jockers_rinker &lt;- chapters %&gt;% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %&gt;%  #tokenize by words
  #anti_join(stop_words) %&gt;%
  left_join(lexicon::hash_sentiment_jockers_rinker, 
             by = c(&quot;word&quot; = &quot;x&quot;), 
             drop = FALSE) %&gt;%
  mutate(y = replace_na(y, 0)) 

#Draw the comparison cloud:
psalms_sentiment_jockers_rinker %&gt;%
  filter(abs(y) &gt; 0) %&gt;%
  mutate(pos = y&gt;0, neg = y&lt;0) %&gt;%
  select(-ch_num, -y) %&gt;%
  group_by(word, pos, neg) %&gt;%
  summarize(cnt = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(Positive = cnt * pos, Negative = cnt * neg) %&gt;%
  ungroup %&gt;%
  select(word, Positive, Negative) %&gt;%
  as.data.frame() %&gt;%
  column_to_rownames(&quot;word&quot;) %&gt;%
  comparison.cloud(title.colors = &quot;black&quot;)</code></pre>

<div id="sentiment-analysis-by-chapter" class="section level1">
<h1>Sentiment Analysis by Chapter</h1>
<p>There is some flexibility in the method that we may choose to compute the sentiment. We could <em>sum</em> the sentiment scores for the words in each chapter, which introduces a relationship between sentiment score and chapter length. Or we could compute the <em>average</em> sentiment over the words in the chapter, either choosing to ignore or include neutral words (i.e. words with score of 0). The inclusion of neutral words in the calculation of the average would dampen the overall sentiment score of the chapter. I think the choice depends on what makes the most sense for each application.</p>
<p>In the interest of better comparing this first calculation to a second calculation using the <code>sentimentr</code> package, I’m going use the mean chapter sentiment (including neutral words). That is, the sentiment for the <span class="math inline">\(j^{th}\)</span> chapter is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S_j =  \frac{1}{n_j} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} s_{ij}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(n_j\)</span> is the word count for chapter <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_{ij}\)</span> is the sentiment score for the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> word in the <span class="math inline">\(j^{th}\)</span> chapter.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Compute sentiment:
psalms_sentiment_jockers_rinker %&lt;&gt;%
  group_by(ch_num) %&gt;%
  summarize(avg_sentiment = mean(y))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-05-18-text-analysis-of-psalms_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We see here that <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+10&amp;version=GNT">Chapter 150</a> is the most positive and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+150&amp;version=GNT">Chapter 10</a> is the most negative. In Chapter 10, the psalmist laments about the wicked and asks God to “hear the desire of the afflicted.” Here is a sample:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“His mouth is full of lies and threats; trouble and evil are under his tongue. He lies in wait near the villages; from ambush he murders the innocent. His eyes watch in secret for his victims; like a lion in cover he lies in wait.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chapter 150 is a short one of praise to God. Here’s a sample:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Praise him with trumpets. Praise him with harps and lyres. Praise him with drums and dancing. Praise him with harps and flutes. Praise him with cymbals. Praise him with loud cymbals. Praise the Lord, all living creatures!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next let’s take another look at the sentiment using the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sentimentr">sentimentr</a> package. It has some nice features such as valence shifters, which are described on the <a href="https://github.com/trinker/sentimentr">package GitHub page</a> as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“So what are these valence shifters? A negator flips the sign of a polarized word (e.g., ‘I do not like it.’). An amplifier (intensifier) increases the impact of a polarized word (e.g., ‘I really like it.’). A de-amplifier (downtoner) reduces the impact of a polarized word (e.g., ‘I hardly like it.’). An adversative conjunction overrules the previous clause containing a polarized word (e.g., ‘I like it but it’s not worth it.’).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>sentimentr</code> GitHub page also discusses the equations used to calculate sentiment. With a bit of work we could apply similar valence shifters with the <code>tidytext</code> package, but it’s nice that it’s automated in <code>sentimentr</code>.</p>
<p>Note that by default this package uses the Jockers &amp; Rinker sentiment dictionary, although it can be swapped out with an alternate.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>psalms_sentiment_w_valence &lt;- chapters %&gt;%
    get_sentences() %$%
    sentiment_by(text, by = ch_num)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-05-18-text-analysis-of-psalms_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Now, after taking valence shifters into account, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+67&amp;version=GNT">Chapter 67</a> is the most positive while <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+10&amp;version=GNT">Chapter 10</a> is still the most negative. Chapter 67 is a short chapter (only 7 verses), a song written for the director of music. Here is a sample of verses 3 and 4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“May the peoples praise you, God; may all the peoples praise you. May the nations be glad and sing for joy, for you rule the peoples with equity and guide the nations of the earth.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chapter 67 seems to have a similar sentiment as <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+119&amp;version=KJV">Chapter 150</a>, which we identified in the previous analysis.</p>
<p>Additionally, between the two analyses, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+13&amp;version=GNT">Chapter 13</a> switched from a very slight negative sentiment (-0.0038) to a somewhat positive sentiment (0.1513). This chapter had the largest score change between the two analyses.</p>

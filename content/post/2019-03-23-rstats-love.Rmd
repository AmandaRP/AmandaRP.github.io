My MO on twitter is to "like" posts that contain information that I'd like remember. The majority of these posts are related to #rstats. I now have 450 likes, which is time consuming to browse through. In this post, I use the [rtweet](https://rtweet.info/index.html) package to summarize my Twitter likes. This was my first time using the `rtweet` package, so I'll also provide a brief intro.


```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '1106185697894023168')
```

To grab the tweets, there is a little setup with Twitter that is necessary. The setup is described on the `rtweet` website [here](https://rtweet.info/index.html).


```{r echo=FALSE}
## load rtweet package
library(rtweet)
```

TODO: Am having issues authenticating token. Install dev version of rtweet. Then follow instructions here:

<p>This year I attended the 2019 rstudio::conf in Austin, TX. 1700+ attendees Next year: San Francisco Jan 27-30</p>
<div id="visualization" class="section level2">
<h2>Visualization</h2>
<p><strong>3D mapping, plotting, and printing with rayshader</strong>, <em>Tyler Morgan-Wall (Institute for Defense Analysis)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Rayshader: building realistic 3D maps from elevation data</li>
<li>Can overlay images onto map. Animations possible. 3-D printing of maps.</li>
<li>Watch the video for lots of cool examples.</li>
<li>Next version will contain 3D ggplots</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>gganimate Live Cookbook</strong>, <em>Thomas Lin Pedersen (Software Engineer, RStudio)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>An implementation of the grammar of animated graphics, extension to ggplot2.</li>
<li>Rewritten completely in the last year.</li>
<li>Now available on CRAN.</li>
<li>How to use:
<ul>
<li>Transitions: you want your data to change</li>
<li>Views: you want your viewpoint to change</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Shadows: you want the animation to have memory</li>
<li>Documentation:
<ul>
<li>www.gganimate.com</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/21ZWDrTukEs" class="uri">https://youtu.be/21ZWDrTukEs</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Transition_reveal: multiple enter/exit options</li>
<li>See slides for examples: www.data-imaginist.com/slides/rstudioconf….</li>
<li>Can also update labels automatically throughout animation.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="modeling" class="section level2">
<h2>Modeling</h2>
<p><strong>Introducing MLflow</strong>, <em>Kevin Kuo (Software Engineer, RStudio)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>MLfow: an open source platform for the machine learning lifecycle.</li>
<li>Motivation:</li>
<li>Keeping track of what you did (trying different hyper-params, going back to a previous experiment, etc)</li>
<li>Reproducability</li>
<li>Lots of different modeling packages and ways to deploy them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Solving the model representation problem with broom</strong>, <em>Alex Hayes (Tidyverse Intern, RStudio)</em> * Model representation problem: Need a standard way to represent models. * Broom tools: + tidy(): summarize info about fit components. Broom cleans up fit for us. + glance(): report goodness of fit measures + augment(): add info about observations to a dataset – not currently defined yet. * Print really pretty table of fit desc: tidy(fit) %&gt;% kable2()<br />
* Compare different models using purrr. (See code on slides) * Real power: working with multiple models at once. * Resource: broom.tidyverse.org * See slides!!! <a href="https://buff.ly/2FGKFkj" class="uri">https://buff.ly/2FGKFkj</a></p>
<p><strong>Parsnip - a tidy model interface (building models)</strong>, <em>Max Kuhn (Engineer, RStudio)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Why parsnip name? White carrot (related to caret) *Motivation for parsnip:</li>
<li>Different packages have different modeling interfaces.</li>
<li>Functions run na.omit silently. Delete data.</li>
<li>Parsnip has a tidy interface</li>
<li>Similar to broom, nicely prints output.</li>
<li>(See modeling package guidelines.)</li>
<li>Ex: set_engine(“glmnet”) , however, engine doesn’t necessarily have to be an R engine.</li>
<li>Next steps:</li>
<li>Add more models and classes of models</li>
<li>Formalize the API and tools for others to add parsnip models to their packages</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why Tensorflow Eager Execution matters</strong>, <em>Sigrid Keydana</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Typically a static graph is generated. New way: eager execution</li>
<li>See blog articles: <a href="https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/" class="uri">https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/</a></li>
</ul>

<li>Resources:</li>
<li>Plumber: www.rplumber.io</li>
<li>openAPI: <a href="https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about" class="uri">https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about</a></li>
<li>Github: github.com/sol-eng/plumber-model</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Vctrs: a new package that provides tools to ensure that functions behave consistently with respect to inputs of varying length and type.</li>
<li>Base R: When combining objects of different classes using c(), the following order of precidence occurs: Logical -&gt; integer -&gt; double -&gt; character (combine 2 types in an atomic vector and you get the type on the right)</li>
<li>Vctrs is more strict than an atomic vector in base R.</li>
<li>Will be integrated into tidyverse packages (behind the scenes) during 2019.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tidy eval context</strong>, <em>Jenny Bryan (Software Engineer, RStudio)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Tidy evaluation is a toolkit for metaprogramming (code that writes/mutates code) in R.</li>
<li>Tidyverse itself does alot of metaprogramming (behind the scenes).</li>
<li>Similar to nonstandard evaluation or unquoted variable names.</li>
<li>Package: rlang (rlang.r-lib.org) … a developer facing package.. Most people will not need to use.</li>
<li>Might need enquo or !! if passing variables to tidyverse function.</li>
<li>My comments: This is more in the low level weeds than I need.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Box plots: a case study in debugging and perseverance</strong>, <em>Kara Woo (Research Scientist, Sage Bionetworks)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Talked through an example of a difficult debugging problem (for the ggplot2 package). * Advice:</li>
<li>Use a reprex (minimal reproducible example) to determine/reproduce problem.</li>
<li>Use “debug” function. (Let’s you step through function.)</li>
<li>How do you know when you are done? Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good.</li>
</ul>

<div id="r-in-production" class="section level2">
<h2>R in Production</h2>
<p><strong>API Development with R and Tensorflow at T-Mobile</strong>, <em>Heather Nolis &amp; Jacqueline Nolis (Machine Learning Engineer &amp; Data Scientist, nolisllc)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>T-mobile has 70 million customers (+ additional from merger with Sprint)</li>
<li>NLP models to classify incoming customer message (including account info) to give live agent a heads up about the likely topic. (They used a CNN via the keras R package.)</li>
<li>Their workflow steps: First rmarkdown for exploratory data analysis. Second show model to business people using a shiny demo to get them interested. Success: Given millions of $ to put it into production.</li>
<li>Was told: “If you want to do ML in production, you have to use Python.” Idea: Treat R like a real programming language (because it is one)! Didn’t want to re-write everything. Steps:</li>
<li>Turn R into an API using plumber</li>
<li>Use docker images (rocker)</li>
<li>Plumber doesn’t support https. Used an appache2 server to reroute.</li>
<li>Container was too big. Swapped miniconda for anaconda. Removed RStudio &amp; some unnecessary Linux, R, and python packages.</li>
<li>This model is now deployed and used in production at T-mobile.</li>
<li>Their docker container is now open source: <a href="https://github.com/tmobile/r-tensorflow-api" class="uri">https://github.com/tmobile/r-tensorflow-api</a></li>
<li>Slides: nollisllc.com/rstudio19</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Keynote: Tareef Kawaf (President, RStudio)</strong>,</p>
<ul>
<li>RStudio maintains 170 R packages</li>
<li>Making the life of an SA better: RStudio Server Pro, RStudio package manager.</li>
<li>Rstudio connect to publish Shiny applications, R Markdown reports, Plumber APIs, dashboards, plots, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Keynote: Shiny in Production</strong>, <em>Joe Cheng (CTO of RStudio)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud.r-project.org : cran mirror managed by RStudio. Download logs available (for that mirror).</li>
<li>Q: Can shiny be used for production. Ans: Yes! (It’s quite easy.) Challenges: Cultural (shiny apps usually developed by R users, who aren’t necessarily SWEs). Organizational (IT and management can be skeptical). Technical (shiny lowers bar for creating web app… but not easy to automated testing, load testing, profiling, and deployment … but RStudio has worked on making this better).</li>
<li>Pet peeve: “R is not a real programming language.” (eye roll)</li>
<li>New tools for shiny in production:</li>
<li>RStudio Connect - Shiny serving with push-button deployment</li>
<li>Shinytest (now on cran) - automated ui testing for shiny</li>
<li>Shinyloadtest - load testing for shiny</li>
<li>Profvis - profiler for R</li>
<li>Plot caching - in Shiny 1.2. Speed up plots. Use if plots are 1) slow, 2) significant fraction of total amt of time the app spending thinking, 3) most users likely to request the same few plots.</li>
<li>Async - last resort for slow portions.</li>
<li>Use shinyloadtest to see if it’s fast enough (generates large amounts of traffic). If not, use profvis to see what’s making it slow. Then optimize: move work out of shiny (very often). Make code faster (very often), using caching (sometimes), use async (occasionally). Repeat.</li>
<li>Deploy apps to either RStudioConnect or Shiny Server.</li>
<li>Reading from feather files is faster than csv.</li>

<div id="data-science" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Science</h2>
<p><strong>Using Data Effectively: Beyond Art and Science</strong>, <em>Hilary Parker (Data Scientist, Stitch Fix)</em> * Stitch Fix has very little data on both the person and the clothing item… traditional matrix factorization (collaborative filtering) does not work well. Soln: They added the “style shuffle” where customer flips through a bunch of clothes and says yes/no to whether they would wear it. This enabled traditional matrix factorization. * R magik package for image processing.</p>
<p><strong>Data Science as a Team Sport</strong>, <em>Angela Bassa (Director of Data Science, iRobot)</em> <span class="citation">@angebassa</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Just because a data scientist can do everything, doesn’t mean they should.</li>
<li>Data engineer != data scientist</li>
<li>When to grow? When you’d like to grow scope &amp; maturity. Adding people will slow things down (additional complexity) unless systems are improved.</li>
<li>When adding people: add specialization (people have different roles in the DS pipeline), add process (documentation, authentication, governance, data provenance, automation: testing, deployment), add resilience (hiring, methodical on-boarding, culture, diversity &amp; inclusion)</li>
<li>Idea: Documentation party … offsite … have pizza.</li>
<li>Hire both experts and interns (the latter question what experts have forgotten to question)</li>
<li>Where should DS team live? Embedded or centralized? Her answer: It doesn’t matter. The importance is how they interact and communicate. But, remember teams don’t scale.</li>
<li>In her experience the best model she’s found is 5-10 data scientists (of differing background/expertise) + ~3 data engineers on a team. If more then split into multiple teams.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Keynote: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Public Work</strong>, <em>David Robinson (Chief Data Scientist, Data Camp)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Work shared publically is way more useful than work local on your computer.</li>
<li>Effective ways to share: blog, tweet, contribute to open source, give talks, record screencasts, write a book.</li>
<li>When you’ve given the same in-person advice 3 times, write a blog post.</li>
<li>If you start a data-related blog, tweet link to <span class="citation">@drob</span> and he’ll tweet about your first post.</li>
<li>What to blog about?</li>
<li>Any paper you’re written. (more exposure)</li>
<li>Current events</li>
<li>TidyTuesday</li>
<li>Teach a concept</li>
<li>Blog about something that you’re learning.</li>
<li>Examples: #datablog hashtag on Twitter</li>
<li>Twitter:</li>
<li>One for each blog post.</li>
<li>Promote others’ work</li>
<li>Tidytuesday evaluation.</li>
<li>What you’ve learned at a conference</li>
<li>Not a great way to document knowledge for long term. Blog better for that.</li>
<li>From:username to search within one person’s tweets.</li>
<li>Contribute to open source:</li>
<li>See Ten Steps to Becoming a Tidyverse Contributor by Nic Crane</li>
<li>Contribute to a beginner-friendly issue</li>
<li>Write R packages (See R Packages book)</li>
<li>Give talks:</li>
<li>See “How to give a data science talk” blog by Emily Robinson</li>
<li>Introvert tip: It makes networking at conferences easier.</li>
<li>Be sure to publish your slides.</li>
<li>Record screencasts:</li>
<li>Limitation: you need to be capable and confident enough to improvise.</li>
<li>Rachel Tatman does live coding on Twitch.</li>
<li>Write a book:</li>
<li>You need a good amount to say and some practice saying it.</li>
<li>R bookdown package. *Slides: bit.ly/drob-rstudio-2019</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Panel Discussion: Growth and Data Science: Individuals, leaders, organizations and responsibilities</strong>, <em>Speakers: Hilary Parker (Data Scientist, Stitch Fix), Karthik Ram (Data Science Fellow, UC Berkeley), Angela Bassa (Director of Data Science, iRobot), Tracy Teal (Exec Dir, Carpentries), Eduardo (Data Science Leader, Instagram)</em> * See Hilary’s “Not so standard data science” podcast * What is the most important thing for success as a data scientist: + Flexibility in tooling (no space for a tooling purist)… but know at least one language fluently. Softer skills (e.g. empathy, understanding user/reader) + If an organization is giving you a hard time about your lack of knowledge as a junior data scientist, consider a different company. Don’t shy away from saying “I don’t know.” Her interview guide has impossible questions to answer… she’s looking for humility to say “I don’t know.” * How to choose to become a DS lead vs staying technical: + Data scientists aren’t necessarily given opportunity to learn/grow leadership skills. Need to be more strategic to grow better leaders. Some DS’s stumble into a management/leadership position. + Angela didn’t want to become a manager and wanted to stay in trenches at first, but now loves it (took the position b/c didn’t want to let her management down).. + + “Management is a skill that is learnable.” If you feel accomplishment from management, great rock it. If you don’t, then no worries don’t be a manger. + It takes personal growth to stop self-depricating yourself as a manager: “I just read email and schedule meetings.” + Fear: Skills will atrophy. Remember “loops are still loops.” Opportunity to develop additional skills. Redefine what success means: How can I enable people to do their best work? * In a growing organization that you’ve been at, what is the most important lesson to do/not do? + Don’t hire DS if you don’t have data. + Adapt as the business grows. + Invest in systems that let people work effectively together + Don’t over hire. No clear success criteria. + For machine learning projects, useful to have a PM that understand machine learning. There types of people can be rare. * Responsibilities as Data scientists: + Data are artifacts…not ground truth. + Own your mistakes. + Make work reproducible. + See datasciencemanifesto.org * What is the most effective way that program management and DS works together: + Product has a road map. Make sure that DS also has a road map and that they are correlated. * What are common ways that data scientists fail? + By not saying “no” enough then only providing a cursery analysis that has little impact. + Assuming the PM knows enough to ask the question in the best way. + Caring more about the stats method/model than solving the problem for the business.</p>

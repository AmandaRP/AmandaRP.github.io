      <description>I just wrapped up another round of teaching stats. I co-teach two courses per year as an adjunct instructor: one class that covers intro stats and the other that hits higher level concepts. Both courses move at a high pace; theyâ€™re intended to be a survey course for professionals with a STEM background. Some students have a math background, but have never taken a statistics course. Other students have had statistics a long time ago in their undergraduate studies, but want to brush up on the material.</description>

      <description>The overview: I had the pleasure of attending rstudio::conf 2019 (in Austin, TX), a conference about all things R and RStudio. Over 1700 people attended the main conference, which consisted of three tracks (so my notes below cover only a third of the conference talks). There were an additional two days of tutorials and a two-day hackathon, which I did not attend. The 2020 conference will be in San Francisco Jan 27-30.</description>

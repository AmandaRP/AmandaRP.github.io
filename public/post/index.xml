      <title>Sentiment Analysis of Psalms</title>

      <description>Psalms is a book in both the Christian Bible and the Jewish Tanakh. I thought it would be interesting to look at a sentiment analysis of the book. I chose to work with the “Good News Translation” of the bible as it does not have copyright issues like some of the other translations (per the American Bible Society). We’ll use the tidytext and sentimentr R packages to do the analysis.</description>

      <title>Introducing the hddtest R package</title>

      <description>I’d like to introduce a package that I wrote recently, hddtest, for two sample hypothesis testing of high dimensional discrete data. The package is currently available on GitHub. It contains methods for both multivariate binary data and multinomial data.
I’ll illustrate the use of one of its functions, the multinomial neighborhood test, by using a dataset included in hddtest called twoNewsGroups. It contains document term frequency matrices for two of the 20 newgroups.</description>

      <description>I love that Twitter came out with bookmarks! My pevious MO on Twitter is to “like” posts that contain information that I want to keep for later, most of which are #rstats tweets. I now have TODO likes, which is time consuming to browse through. In this post, I use the rtweet package to summarize my Twitter likes. This was my first time using the rtweet package, so I’ll also provide a brief intro.</description>

      <title>Statistics Bingo</title>

      <description>I just wrapped up another round of teaching stats. I co-teach two courses per year as an adjunct instructor: one class that covers intro stats and the other that hits higher level concepts. Both courses move at a high pace; they’re intended to be a survey course for professionals with a STEM background. Some students have a math background, but have never taken a statistics course. Other students have had statistics a long time ago in their undergraduate studies, but want to brush up on the material.</description>

      <title>rstudio::conf recap</title>

      <description>The overview: I had the pleasure of attending rstudio::conf 2019 (in Austin, TX), a conference about all things R and RStudio. Over 1700 people attended the main conference, which consisted of three tracks (so my notes below cover only a third of the conference talks). There were an additional two days of tutorials and a two-day hackathon, which I did not attend. The 2020 conference will be in San Francisco Jan 27-30.</description>

      <description>I love that Twitter came out with bookmarks! My pevious MO on Twitter was to “like” posts that contain information that I want to keep for later, most of which are #rstats tweets. I now have TODO likes, which is time consuming to browse through. In this post, I use the rtweet package to build a shiny app for browsing my favorites. You can use it to browse yours, too!</description>

      <description>The overview: I had the pleasure of attending rstudio::conf 2019 (in Austin, TX), a conference about all things R and RStudio. Over 1700 people attended the main conference, which consisted of three tracks (so my notes below cover only a third of the conference talks). There were an additional two days of tutorials and a two-day hackathon, which I did not attend. The 2020 conference will be in San Francisco Jan 27-30.</description>

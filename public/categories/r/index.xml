      <description>My MO on Twitter is to “like” posts that contain information that I want to keep for later, most of which are #rstats tweets. I now have 450 likes, which is time consuming to browse through. In this post, I use the rtweet package to summarize my Twitter likes. This was my first time using the rtweet package, so I’ll also provide a brief intro. Click here to jump to the summary.</description>

      <description>The overview: I had the pleasure of attending rstudio::conf 2019 (in Austin, TX), a conference about all things R and RStudio. Over 1700 people attended the main conference, which consisted of three tracks (so my notes below cover only a third of the conference talks). There were an additional two days of tutorials and a two-day hackathon, which I did not attend. The 2020 conference will be in San Francisco Jan 27-30.</description>

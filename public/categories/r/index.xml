      <title>Shiny App: Twitter Likes Browser</title>

      <description>I love that Twitter recently came out with bookmarks! My previous MO on Twitter was to “like” posts that contain information that I want to keep for later, most of which are #rstats tweets. I now have 700+ likes, which are time consuming to browse through when I need to find something. I didn’t find an easy way to search likes within Twitter itself, so I built a shiny app to do that using the rtweet and shiny R packages.</description>

      <title>rstudio::conf recap</title>

      <description>The overview: I had the pleasure of attending rstudio::conf 2019 (in Austin, TX), a conference about all things R and RStudio. Over 1700 people attended the main conference, which consisted of three tracks (so my notes below cover only a third of the conference talks). There were an additional two days of tutorials and a two-day hackathon, which I did not attend. The 2020 conference will be in San Francisco Jan 27-30.</description>
